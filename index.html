        The guinea pig or domestic guinea pig (Cavia porcellus), also known as
        the cavy or domestic cavy, is a species of rodent belonging to the genus
        Cavia in the family Caviidae. Breeders tend to use the name "cavy" for
        the animal, but "guinea pig" is more commonly used in scientific and
        laboratory contexts.Despite their name, guinea pigs are not native to
        Guinea, nor are they closely related to pigs. They originated in the
        Andes region of South America. Studies based on biochemistry and
        hybridization suggest they are domesticated animals that do not exist
        naturally in the wild, and are descendants of a closely related cavy
        species such as C. tschudii.They were originally domesticated as
        livestock for a source of meat, and are still consumed in some parts of
        the world.

        In Western society, the guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as
        a pet since its introduction to Europe and North America by European
        traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature, friendly
        responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring
        for them have continued to make guinea pigs a popular choice of
        household pet. Organizations devoted to the competitive breeding of
        guinea pigs have been formed worldwide. Many specialized breeds, with
        varying coat colors and textures, are selected by breeders.
